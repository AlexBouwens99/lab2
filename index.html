            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>Posted by BGB, <time datetime="2016-11-15">November 15, 2016</time></p>
        </header>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as “ultra-low-temperature poaching.”</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</em>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
